I would not assume that any of these data points is normally distributed necessarily; while population scores should be normally distributed and prestige scores should be evenly distributed, there may well be a bias in this particular population of applicants. I wouldn't be surprised to find a left-skewed distribution, where a presumably self-selected pool of applicants tends to have higher scores than average on all measures."

First, I'd identify distributions and potential outliers by creating histograms and box plots for the data. I'd also run a specific script looking for outliers and missing values; both types of cases should be omitted given the highly prescribed range of values in our predictive variable set. Then, I'd create scatter plots for each variable against each other to check whether any of our variables are strongly colinear, which would inform how strongly they should be weighted in our model."

The alternative problem statement presupposes that there is some correlation between the outcome we were initially predicting (admission to grad school) and the new one (prestige), not to mention between the other variables.
